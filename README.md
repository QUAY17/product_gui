# product_gui

This Java program uses JavaFx in IntelliJ to create a Graphical User Interface that details features of a product. Users will use the various gui controls to select product features. Controllers are programmed on the backend to perform various action responses. When the Summary button is pressed, it will show the summary of all the values in the controls. When the Save button is pressed, the program pops up the Save File Dialog box. When the user enters a file name and presses Save, the current selections and theme information is written to a text-based file.
